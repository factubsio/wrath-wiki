Familiars also aid a witch by granting her {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g}, additional {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g}, and help with some types of magic.\nA witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows, and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her familiar. A witch\u0027s familiar begins play storing all of the 0-level witch spells plus three 1st level spells of the witch\u0027s choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her {g|Encyclopedia:Intelligence}Intelligence{/g} modifier to store in her familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual.",

This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.\nAt 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch\u0027s patron adds new {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} to a witch\u0027s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen.",
