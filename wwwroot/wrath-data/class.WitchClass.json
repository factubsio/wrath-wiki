Maybe the patron of such a witch was cruel and decided that power mustn\u0027t come cheap, or, maybe, they mercifully helped the witch to turn the adversities that befell her into a source of new {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}strength{/g}. A stigmatized witch relies on intuition, her magic is based not on the sharpness of her wit, but on the strength of her character. Instead of the regular powers granted by a patron, such a witch gets a curse like an oracle, and she casts her {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} spontaneously \u2014 like a sorcerer, rather than a wizard.",

Her mind and body begin to transform to reflect her new being. Hagbound witches suffer a slow transformative taint that is similar to the accursed corruption and make ideal candidates for this additional power \u2014 and tragedy.",
