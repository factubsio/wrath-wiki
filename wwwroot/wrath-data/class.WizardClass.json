A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.\nEach arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard\u0027s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feat{/g} to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.",
