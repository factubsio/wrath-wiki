While this is a blanket term for all Hellknights-in-training (including those training to become signifers), it also applies specifically to fighters who focus their training to become Hellknights. Despite their lack of recognized rank, armigers are skilled and deadly warriors.\nMost armigers live and train at their order\u0027s citadel, working toward the day when they become full-fledged Hellknights. These armigers follow a brutally strict routine; they spend hours honing their combat skills against other trainees, obsessively studying in the citadel\u0027s libraries, or memorizing passages of the Hellknight philosophy known as the Measure and the Chain. At regular intervals, squads of armigers emerge from their citadels to patrol nearby cities or frontier lands, working to enforce Hellknight law and their order\u0027s edicts.",
