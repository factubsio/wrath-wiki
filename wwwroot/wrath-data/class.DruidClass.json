When determining the powers and bonus {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g} granted by this domain, the druid\u0027s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.\nThe second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion\u0027s {g|Encyclopedia:Hit_Dice}Hit Dice{/g}, abilities, {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skills{/g}, and {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g} advance as the druid advances in level.
