A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g} per day equal to 4 \u002B his {g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g} modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day.

In addition, he gains a \u002B2 dodge bonus to {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}Armor Class{/g} and 2 temporary {g|Encyclopedia:HP}hit points{/g} per {g|Encyclopedia:Hit_Dice}Hit Die{/g}. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means.\nThe stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}action{/g}; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls {g|Encyclopedia:Injury_Death}unconscious{/g}, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell).",
