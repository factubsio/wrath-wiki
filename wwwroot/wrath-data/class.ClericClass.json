      "desc": "Regardless of {g|Encyclopedia:Alignment}alignment{/g}, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or {g|Encyclopedia:Healing}heal{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.\nA good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g}.\nChanneling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g} points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will save{/g} to halve the damage. The {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of this save is equal to 10 \u002B 1/2 the cleric\u0027s level \u002B the cleric\u0027s {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total\u2014all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 \u002B her Charisma modifier. This is a {g|Encyclopedia:Standard_Actions}standard action{/g} that does not provoke an {g|Encyclopedia:Attack_Of_Opportunity}attack of opportunity{/g}. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.",
