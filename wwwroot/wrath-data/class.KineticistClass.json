      "desc": "At 1st level, a kineticist can overexert herself to channel more power than normal, pushing past the limit of what is safe for her body by accepting burn. Some of her wild talents allow her to accept burn in exchange for a greater effect, while others require her to accept a certain amount of burn to use that talent at all. For each point of burn she accepts, a kineticist takes (1 per {g|Encyclopedia:Character_Level}character level{/g}) points of\u00A0nonlethal {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}. This damage can\u0027t be {g|Encyclopedia:Healing}healed{/g} by any means other than getting a full night\u0027s {g|Encyclopedia:Rest}rest{/g}, which removes all burn and associated\u00A0nonlethal damage. Nonlethal damage from burn can\u0027t be reduced or redirected, and a kineticist incapable of taking\u00A0nonlethal damage\u00A0can\u0027t accept burn. A kineticist can accept only 1 point of burn per {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g}. This limit rises to 2 points of burn at 6th level, and rises by 1 additional point every 3 levels thereafter. A kineticist can\u0027t choose to accept burn if it would put her total number of points of burn higher than (3 \u002B her\u00A0{g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g}\u00A0modifier), though she can be forced to accept more burn from a source outside her control. A kineticist who has accepted burn never benefits from abilities that allow her to ignore or alter the effects she receives from\u00A0nonlethal damage.",

She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion.\nSome infusions change the {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}action{/g} required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast\u0027s normal effects.\nThe burn cost listed in each infusion\u0027s Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies.\nThe {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} for a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}save{/g} against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast\u0027s effective {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} level, not the level of the infusion. The DCs for form infusions are calculated using the kineticist\u0027s\u00A0{g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} modifier instead of her\u00A0{g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g}\u00A0modifier. When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion. If a target succeeds and a successful save negates the infusion\u0027s effects, the entire kinetic blast is negated; otherwise, the target then attempts a saving throw against the substance infusion. If a kineticist\u0027s form and substance infusions both alter the kinetic blast\u0027s {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}, apply the substance infusion\u0027s alteration first.",

She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast. All {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing\u00A0{g|Encyclopedia:Damage_Reduction}damage reduction{/g}. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g} such as\u00A0Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast, and she can\u0027t use\u00A0Vital Strike\u00A0feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any {g|Encyclopedia:Size}size{/g} (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms).\nEach simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast.\nPhysical blasts are {g|Encyclopedia:RangedAttack}ranged attacks{/g} that deal an amount of damage equal to {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g}\u002B1 \u002B the kineticist\u0027s\u00A0{g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g}\u00A0modifier, increasing by 1d6\u002B1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. {g|Encyclopedia:Spell_Resistance}Spell resistance{/g} doesn\u0027t apply against physical blasts.\nEnergy blasts are ranged {g|Encyclopedia:TouchAttack}touch attacks{/g} that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 \u002B 1/2 the kineticist\u0027s\u00A0Constitution\u00A0modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.\nComposite blasts combine elements to form a new blast.
